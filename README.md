Hi there, welcome to MOMENTO.

Introducing MOMENTO, a digital time capsule for capturing weekly moments in an image-based visual timeline. The project was born from the struggle of capturing meaningful moments in a fast-paced world. MOMENTO encourages users to pause and reflect by selecting one standout image per week, tagging it with date, location, and a brief description. It's about remembering the everyday, creating a living visual timeline to revisit life's journey. Download the code from GitHub and create your own MOMENTO.

I encourage anyone familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to download this repository and create your own MOMENTO by followign the instructions in the code files.

Please reach out if you have any queries or questions.

Happy documenting! ðŸ“¸
