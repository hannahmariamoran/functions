Hi there, welcome to MOMENTO!

To create you own MOMENTO timeline follow the instructions below. 

To change code in the:
    
     - index.html
     - style.css
     - main.js

Look out for the '🚨' emoji.

🧑‍💻 –––––––––– STEP 1 = COLLATE YOUR IMAGES –––––––––––––––––

1. Source and collate your images that you would like to put in your timeline. Make sure you select one image per week.
2. Name the images 'WeekXX_YYYY', for example 'Week12_2024', to match the corresponding year and week.

🧑‍💻 –––––––––– STEP 2 = TURN YOUR IMAGES INTO URLS ––––––––––

1. Turn your images into URLS. There is multiple ways you can do this. I suggest uploading them to a platform like Are.na where you can later get the source url after uploading them.

🧑‍💻 –––––––––– STEP 3 = COLLATE IMAGE INFO ––––––––––––––––––

1. Create a google drive and begin collating the metadata for your image collection.
2. Create columns for the following categories: 'Year' , 'Week' , 'Image', 'Date', 'Location', 'Title', 'Description', 'Alt Text'
3. Paste the image url in the 'Image' category.

🧑‍💻 –––––––––– STEP 4 = EDIT 'data.json' FILE –––––––––––––––

1. Using the image information you collated, edit the 'data.json' file.
2. Populate each parentheses set for each images as follows:

    {
        "Year": "YYYY",
        "Week": "Week XX",
        "Image": "your image url,
        "Date": "DD MM",
        "Location": "Location of Image",
        "Title": "Image title",
        "Description": "Image description",
        "Alt Text": "Image Alt Text"
    },

🧑‍💻 –––––––––– STEP 5 = EDIT 'year.json' FILE –––––––––––––––

1. Edit the 'year.json' file for each year you have content for in the following format:

    {
        "Year": "YYYY",
        "Description": "Write a brief description about the year and paste it here."
    },

🧑‍💻 –––––––––– STEP 6 = ADD images to 'assets' folder ––––––

1. Pick your fvourite '8 images' and add them as PNGs to the 'assets' folder, deleting the exisitng images.

🧑‍💻 –––––––––– STEP 7 = ADD favicon to 'assets' folder –––––

1. Add your favicon as a SVG to the 'assets' folder, deleting the exisitng favicon.

🧑‍💻 –––––––––– STEP 8 = EDIT THE 'index.html' FILE ––––––––––

1. At line '11' change the name from Hannah to your own name.
2. At line '15' change the favicon to the one you added to the 'assets' folder.
3. At line '69' change the url and svg to a website you want to link.
4. At line '75' change the url to your own GitHub repo page.
5. At line '82' change the url to your own personal link.
6. At lines '106' to '113', change the images to the ones you added to the 'assets' folder.

🧑‍💻 –––––––––– STEP 9 = EDIT THE 'style.html' FILE –––––––––– = only complete this step if you add content outside of the years listed

1. At line '30', add a colour variable for your added year.
2. At line '188', add in a button for your added year, with the corresponding colour variable.

🧑‍💻 –––––––––– STEP 10 = EDIT THE 'main.js' FILE ––––––––––– = only complete this step if you add content outside of the years listed

1. At line '133' add a const for your added 'btnYYYY' button.
2. At line '145' add a const for your added 'itemsYYYY' item.
3. At lines '160' add a const for your added 'yearYYYY' item.
4. At line '161' change the const to include your add year.
5. At line '174' add your new button backgroud colour.

6. If you are adding content from a new year not define as 2022, 2023 or 2024 add the following function:

    Where ever you see '20YY' change it for the year you added

    // Function to render 20YY items
    btn20YY.onclick = () => {
    console.log("20YY btn clicked");

    // Reset background color of all buttons
    resetButtonColors();

    // Change background color of the clicked button
    btn20YY.style.backgroundColor = getComputedStyle(document.documentElement).getPropertyValue('--year20YY');

    //hide everything
    Array.from(itemAll).forEach(item => {
        console.log(item);
        item.style.display = 'none';
    });
    //show 20YY
    Array.from(items20YY).forEach(item => {
        item.style.display = '';
    });

    //year
      Array.from(yearAll).forEach(item => {
        item.style.display = 'none';
    });
    Array.from(year20YY).forEach(item => {
        item.style.display = '';
    });
}

7. At line '291' change 'year2422' to include your added year 'year24YY'.
8. At line '333' change 'year2422' to include your added year 'year24YY'.
