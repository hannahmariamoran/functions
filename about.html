        <h2>About Momento</h2>
        <p>Introducing MOMENTO, a digital time capsule that allows users to capture weekly moments in an image-based visual timeline. The story behind MOMENTO is rooted in my inability to slow down and capture moments that stand out to me. I want to become better at pausing to take things in, which can seem difficult in this fast-paced world that we live in. Either I take too many photos and end up deleting them as they clog my camera roll, or I have no photos to show at all. The purpose is not to wait for a 'special' moment, but to capture anything that feels meaningful or stands out, and at the end of the week, pick one 'MOMENTO' to add to the timeline. Once you have picked the image you want to add to the timeline you can then tag it with the date and location, as well as give it a short description. The goal is for this to be a living timeline, which is continuously updated, allowing users to look back on the changes in their lives. </p>
