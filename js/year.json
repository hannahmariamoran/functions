I started the year off in Sweden for Christmas, followed by a quick trip to London before retunring to New York for my second semester at Parsons.

        "Description": "This past year felt like a blur. I was pretty stuck in to the final semester of my undergraduate studies which accumulaed in an amazing showcase of all my classmates incredible capstones. I then took some time out to backpack in Europe before moving to New York to start my Master's degree. The year certainly had its ups and downs but I feel that I came out stronger."

        "Description": "As you will see there are a few gaps in this year. This is primarily down to be being unindated with work and assignments between college and internships that I did not feel like I had 'exciting' moments to capture. However, I am trying to be better at embracing the ordinary as well. During my summer internship I discovered that my passion for design lies more specifically in product and ux which was an exciting discovery."
